          <ul>
          <li>Sears<br></li>
          <li>Sautes<br></li>
          <li>Delgazes<br></li>

          <h4>DVD Review</h4>
          <p>There are a lot of cooking videos on the market but this is one of 
            the best I've seen. It's all about the food and the cooking techniques 
            ... not the guy doing it. </p>
          <p>If you are looking for great video quality and easy to follow 
            instructions from a chef who knows what he is talking about, you should 
            consider buying this cooking DVD. You can watch and learn how to cook 
            like a professional with the best food photography I've seen, and make 
            hundreds of recipes using the same techniques.</p>
